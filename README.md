Healthcare is rapidly developing every day. With an increased number of patients needing care around the world, hospitals have to be on top of their game and people aware of their health. But one should not be needing to visiting a doctor to get an SpO2 test as this would crowd hospitals.

The problem is that with technology advancing, healthcare must keep up the pace and enter the age of IoT. Hospitals have taken great leaps to digitalise their records and recipes but what happens when the patient leaves the hospital with a disease such as COPD? How does the doctor know if the patient is recovering without the need of constant visits?

As people become more conscious of their health, they will want to monitor their vitals easily without the need of an overpriced oximeter that uncomfortably squeezes their arm. There must be a quicker and more convenient way of achieving this reading!

Introducing MyPulse, a smart IoT device that can sample the user’s heart rate and SpO2 (blood oxygen) levels in 30 seconds. MyPulse is a device that can be placed anywhere in a house or a hospital. All the user has to do to get their pulse is place their finger on the sensor.

This means that hospitals would not need to assign nurses to take the patient’s pulse before a check-up as the patient will be able to record it in seconds by simply placing their finger on the sensor.

The doctor will not need to create appointments to ensure that his COPD patient is feeling better as the patient can record his/her own vitals and the doctor can access this data in seconds from any device, at any time.

Finally, one does not need to strap on a band that squeezes their wrist and stand still for two minutes to get their heart rate after an exercise, but only place their finger on the sensor for 30 seconds. They can then visualise their progress over time from their phone or even their smart watch on an interactive dashboard.
